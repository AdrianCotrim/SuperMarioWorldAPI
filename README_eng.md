# **Super Mario World API**

## **INTRODUCTION**

A **Super Mario World API** é um projeto de estudo que fornece uma interface para acessar dados estruturados sobre o clássico jogo [_Super Mario World_ (1990)](https://www-mariowiki-com.translate.goog/Super_Mario_World?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=pt&_x_tr_hl=pt&_x_tr_pto=tc), desenvolvido para o [_Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)_](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System).

A API permite que desenvolvedores, entusiastas e pesquisadores consultem informações detalhadas sobre elementos do jogo, como mundos, inimigos, chefes e suas respectivas características. O objetivo é oferecer uma maneira acessível e organizada de explorar e reutilizar esses dados em aplicações, análises ou projetos relacionados.

**What will you find in the API?**

- **Characters:** Details on iconic heroes and villains.
- **Power-ups:** Description of items that grant special abilities.
- **Inimigos:** Information about the opponents faced by Mario.
- **Bosses:** Profiles of the bosses of each stage.
- **Worlds:** Complete description of the worlds.
- **Collectible Items:** Information about interactive objects throughout the adventure.

The **Super Mario World API** provides access to this data in a structured way, allowing easy integration for personal projects, studies and even new interactive experiences based on the game's universe.
